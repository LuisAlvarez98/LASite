                  <hr>
                  <p style="font-style: italic;">Monterrey, Mexico. Since 20/12/1998</p>
                  <h6>Instituto Irlandes de Monterrey (13 years) </h6>
                  <p>In this period I obtained more than 20 academic medals, two diplomas of effort, I was in the robotics team for two years and I obtained the certifications in excel, word and powerpoint. I was also in a football club for a year and I was on the school's soccer team.</p>

                  <h6>Highschool: Prepa Tec</h6>
                  <p>
                    In this period I realized what I really wanted to do, which is to develop software to break the paradigms and change the world towards a better good. In this period I participated in three hackathons, I was in the computer honors course and was in the top 20 of 100 projects in a competition of entrepreneurs of the ITESM. </p>

                  <h6>Life Plan</h6>
                  <p>I hope in the very near future, to have my own company that has something to do with information technologies and that makes a change in the lives of others. What I look for in the years of my career is to prepare myself through internships and then implement what I learned in a new concept or idea that breaks the current paradigms.</p>
                  <h6>Hobbies</h6>
                  <p> I do not have a specific hobby, but I like to try and learn new things day by day. But what I like to do the most in my free time is to play the piano, program or play video games such as Overwatch and Fallout.</p>

                  <h6>Personal Code of ethics</h6>
                  <p>Fulfill what I say,  Offer good quality solutions, Be honest with myself and with others, When doing a job see if that said work does not affect others and be fair with everyone.</p>

              <hr>
              <h6>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Technology Engineering (ITC)</h6>
              <p>This bachelor is about the  development of software to improve the quality of life of society and support the competitiveness of organization.The training is based on the areas of software engineering,
                 computer science and information technology infrastructure, which allows you to create all kinds of computer applications, from personal and daily
                 use to those specialized in the scientific, technical, engineering and of business. </p>
              <h6>Academic life plan</h6>
              <p>In a future I would like to go study to one of the most prestigious universities such as MIT, Georgia Tech or Stanford. Also, if my first plan does not work I would like to continue my Italian in the Polytechnic of Turin. For the social service part, I would like to give workshops to public or private schools about technology and programming languages. For the professional practices I would like to start on second or fourth semester and I would like to have these outside Mexico in a high-tech company such as Google, Facebook or Twitter.</p>
